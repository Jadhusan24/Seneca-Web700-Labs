## Setting up Express Server

Follow these steps to set up an Express server for your project:

1. **Initialize npm:**
    ```bash
    npm init
    ```
    - Follow the text-based wizard and accept all default values.
    - Upon completion, a `package.json` file will appear in the root of your project folder.

2. **Install Express:**
    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```
    - This command installs the Express module and creates a `node_modules` folder.
    - You'll also see a `package-lock.json` file generated in the root of your project folder.

With these steps completed, you'll have a basic setup for your Express server. You can now start building and expanding your application using Express framework features.
