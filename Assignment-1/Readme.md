# Web Server Simulator

This simple web server simulator responds to random HTTP requests using predefined routes. It includes an `httpRequest` function that matches HTTP verbs and paths to predefined responses, as well as an automated testing function `automateTests` that continuously sends random requests.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine

3. Install Dependencies:
